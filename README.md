## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm
- **Google Gemini API Key** (for AI naming features) - Get one at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### Installation

1. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Build frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Configure AI (Optional)**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env file and add your Gemini API key
   # GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
   
   Get your Gemini API key from: [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   
   **Note**: The application works fully without an API key, but AI naming features will show "API not configured" messages.

### Running the Application

**Start the server (combined API + frontend)**:
```bash
python main.py
```

The application will be available at: **http://localhost:8000**

## Development Workflow

### Making Frontend Changes

1. Make changes to files in `frontend/src/`
2. Rebuild frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Refresh browser to see changes

### Making Backend Changes

1. Make changes to files in `backend/`
2. FastAPI auto-reloads, so just refresh browser

### Development Commands

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm run install-frontend

# Build frontend for production
npm run build

# Run frontend in development mode (if needed)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

## Usage

1. **Upload Excel File**: 
   - Click upload area or drag & drop an Excel file
   - Supported formats: .xlsx, .xls
   - File size limit: 50MB

2. **Select Sheet**: 
   - Choose from available sheets in dropdown
   - All sheets in workbook are automatically detected

3. **Enter Cell Address**: 
   - Use Excel format: A1, B5, AC123, etc.
   - Case insensitive input with auto-uppercase

4. **Analyze Cell**: 
   - Click "Analyze Cell" to get cell information
   - View value, formula, complexity, and drill-down capability

5. **Multi-Level Drill-down**: 
   - If cell has dependencies, drill-down table appears with new Name column
   - Click chevron icons OR click on ANY formula cell to expand its dependencies
   - **True nested expansion**: Each formula cell becomes clickable for further drill-down
   - **Drivers appear above the formulas that use them** (proper financial modeling flow)
   - Navigate through unlimited levels of dependencies
   - View hierarchical relationships with visual indentation
   - Collapse/expand individual dependency branches

6. **Smart Naming Workflow**:
   - Initial view shows technical references like "Segments!BT71" with dropdown in Name column
   - Click dropdown to see row values from first few columns: [" ", "62", "Operating Income (loss)", "-1"]
   - Select meaningful option (e.g., "Operating Income (loss)" from column C)
   - **All cells from that worksheet instantly get meaningful names**
   - Other worksheets remain technical until you configure them
   - Configuration persists throughout your analysis session

7. **ðŸ¤– AI Naming Workflow**:
   - Click **"ðŸ¤– Generate AI Names"** button above the drill-down table
   - AI analyzes Excel context and generates contextual names for all visible cells
   - See results in new "AI Name" column with confidence percentages
   - **Click any AI name to edit manually** - edited names appear in red text
   - Repeated button clicks only process newly revealed cells from drill-downs
   - AI names persist across sheet navigation and session

## Troubleshooting

### Frontend not loading
- Ensure you've run `npm run build` to build the frontend
- Check that `frontend/dist/` directory exists with built files

### Python import errors
- Make sure you're in the project root directory when running `python main.py`
- Verify all Python dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Cell analysis not working
- Check cell address format (must be like A1, B5, AC123)
- Ensure the selected sheet name exists in the Excel file
- Verify the cell contains a formula for drill-down capability

### Upload fails
- Check file format (.xlsx or .xls only)
- Ensure file size is under 50MB
- Try a different Excel file to isolate the issue

## ðŸš€ Known Issues

### AI Names Section Visibility (Analyze Mode)
- **Issue**: The "Generate AI Names" section remains visible in Analyze mode despite multiple hiding attempts
- **Impact**: Minor UI inconsistency - section should be hidden when in Analyze mode
- **Workaround**: Section functionality is not needed in Analyze mode, so can be ignored
- **Technical Details**: State synchronization issue between tab appearance and content visibility logic
- **Status**: Unresolved - would require deeper investigation of React state management

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

Ready for implementation when needed:

### Advanced Analysis Features
