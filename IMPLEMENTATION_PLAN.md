# Model Analysis - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

A single file Excel financial model analyzer that allows users to drill down on any cell containing formulas. Built with FastAPI backend serving a React frontend in a combined architecture.

## âœ… Project Status: COMPLETED

All core functionality has been implemented and is fully operational. The application is ready for production use.

## User Flow

1. **Upload**: User uploads a single Excel (.xlsx) file âœ…
2. **Select**: User selects a sheet from dropdown menu âœ…
3. **Input**: User enters cell address (e.g., "A1", "B5") âœ…
4. **Analyze**: App shows multi-level drill-down analysis âœ…
   - **Tabular View**: True nested multi-level drill-down with drivers appearing above formulas âœ…
   - **Interactive Expansion**: Click on ANY formula cell to drill down further âœ…
   - **Hierarchical Structure**: Unlimited depth exploration with visual indentation âœ…
   - **Graph View**: Placeholder ready for future implementation ðŸ”„

## Architecture Decisions

### Combined Serving Architecture
- **Single Process**: FastAPI serves both API endpoints and React frontend
- **Development**: `python main.py` starts everything on localhost:8000
- **Frontend Build**: `npm run build` â†’ FastAPI serves from `/frontend/dist/`
- **Benefits**: No CORS issues, single port, production-ready from start

### Multi-Level Drill-Down Logic âœ… ENHANCED
- Start with user-selected cell
- **NEW**: True nested expansion - each formula cell becomes individually expandable
- **NEW**: Click on any dependency to drill down into its sub-dependencies  
- **NEW**: Hierarchical tree structure with unlimited depth
- Stop conditions: constants, external file references, or user choice
- Visual indentation shows dependency levels
- Collapse/expand individual branches independently

### File Storage
- Local uploads folder: `backend/uploads/{session_id}/`
- Session-based file management
- Temporary storage with cleanup

## âœ… Implementation Completed

All core implementation phases have been successfully completed:

### âœ… Phase 1: Project Setup (COMPLETED)
- Monorepo structure with combined FastAPI+React serving
- Code copied and adapted from financial_model_analyzer 
- FastAPI main.py serving both API and static frontend

### âœ… Phase 2: Backend Development (COMPLETED)
- Single file upload API endpoint (`/api/upload`)
- Progressive drill-down API endpoints:
  - `/api/sheets/{session_id}` - List available sheets
  - `/api/analyze/{session_id}/{sheet}/{cell}` - Cell formula analysis
  - `/api/drill-down/{session_id}/{sheet}/{cell}` - Progressive dependency tree
- Session-based file management with cleanup
- External reference detection and handling

### âœ… Phase 3: Frontend Development (COMPLETED + ENHANCED)
- React frontend build process with Vite + TypeScript
- Single file upload component with drag & drop
- Sheet selector + A1-format cell input with validation
- **ENHANCED**: Multi-level nested drill-down visualization (drivers above formulas)
- **NEW**: Click-to-expand functionality for individual dependencies
- **NEW**: True hierarchical tree structure with visual indentation
- **NEW**: Individual loading states for each dependency expansion
- Graph visualization placeholder with tab interface
- Comprehensive error handling and loading states

### âœ… Phase 4: Testing & Integration (COMPLETED)

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python 3.8+, openpyxl
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Development**: Combined serving architecture
- **Deployment**: Railway (future)

## Development Workflow

1. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   Serves both API and frontend at http://localhost:8000

2. **Frontend Development**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build    # Rebuild after changes
   ```

3. **Backend Development**:
   - FastAPI auto-reloads on Python file changes
   - API available at http://localhost:8000/api/*

## Code Reuse Strategy

### Files to Copy from financial_model_analyzer:
- `services/formula_analyzer.py` - Core analysis engine
- `utils/excel_utils.py` - Excel file handling utilities  
- Upload component patterns (adapt for single file)
- TypeScript type definitions
- Tailwind CSS configuration

### Adaptations Required:
- Modify upload logic for single file instead of dual files
- Adapt FormulaAnalyzer for progressive drill-down
- Simplify React components for single model workflow
- Update API endpoints for single file analysis

The following enhancements are ready for implementation when needed:

### Graph Visualization
- Interactive dependency graph using D3.js or similar
- Node-link diagram showing formula relationships
